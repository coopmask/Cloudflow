This project is a subscription-based platform that is fully responsive and keeps in mind the user experience with a highlighted navbar, dark/light mode, and scroll-up button. The dark mode feature saves the preference to the local storage so that users can always open the site in said view. The inspiration for the project was based off the WordPress ThemeForest design preview, Sofbox (https://preview.themeforest.net/item/sofbox-wordpress-software-landing-page/full_screen_preview/22739500?_ga=2.148625015.1391593908.1645822059-2092866599.1645822059). My reason for creating this proejct was to get experience creating an entire website from scratch with many different subsections and designs. One part of the project that troubled me greatly was the marquee/text scroller right below the main home page; the marquee HTML tag could have been used, but it was outdated so I wanted to find a workaround and created two divs with two sets of duplicate blocks of h2 elements (all the scrolling text items) in order to make it infinite.
