This project is a subscription-based platform that is fully responsive and keeps in mind the user experience with a highlighted navbar, dark/light mode, and scroll-up button. The dark mode feature saves the preference to the local storage so that users can always open the site in said view. The inspiration for the project was based off the WordPress ThemeForest design preview, Sofbox (https://preview.themeforest.net/item/sofbox-wordpress-software-landing-page/full_screen_preview/22739500?_ga=2.148625015.1391593908.1645822059-2092866599.1645822059).
